# Meetup Mailer

This folder contains email templates to be used exclusively on meetup.com website to email community members. This template is tailored to work with the ridiculously janky way meetup handles HTML, so do not attempt to use this template elsewhere.

## Steps to using HTML in your meetup emails.

1. From the meetup group home page, clik 'Manage Group' and select 'Contact Members'.
2. On this page, select the appropriate audience you want to email it to and a suitable Subject line.
3. On the Message box, click on 'HTML' visible as the last option on the top bar of the message box.
4. Paste the HTML template into the pop-up Edit HTML box and click on 'Update'.
5. Verify if it's displayed correctly and hit 'Submit'.
