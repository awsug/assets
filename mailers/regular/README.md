# Regular e-Mail Template
You can use these html templates to send out emails to your respective User Groups using regular emailing applications like Gmail, Outlook, SES, SendGrid, MailChimp etc.

Kindly do NOT use this template on meetup, instead use the one in the meetup folder.

## Responsive Template
If your emailing software supports the ability to have css/html based templates, then use the reponsive one instead.
